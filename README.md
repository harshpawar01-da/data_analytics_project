# 🌏 Mumbai Air Quality Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **Mumbai’s air quality** using open datasets.  
It demonstrates **end-to-end data analytics skills** – from **data cleaning** to **exploratory analysis**, **SQL insights**, **time-series forecasting**, and **dashboard storytelling**.  

The aim is to show how **data analysis can support real-world decisions** for:
- Urban planning & policy makers  
- Healthcare & insurance  
- Environmental NGOs  
- Businesses (e.g., air purifier companies, tourism, logistics)
